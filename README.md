# jQueryUI Playground

This is a small project I made to practice jQuery and jQueryUI animations. 
Using:  jQuery 
        jQueryUI 
        Materialize

I also took the opportunity to play with the Materialize library http://materializecss.com/ instead of using Bootstrap like in my other projects. 
With this project I also could see in "live" some of the important considerations with JavaScript I read in the YouDontknow JS books, like function scope, closure, etc.

You can see it live in https://codepen.io/DalonsoAG/full/JrWWRE/
